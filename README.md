# MarkovWeather

Markov Weather uses Markov chains to extrapolate weather data and determine whether a given day will be a good or bad one. It uses different probabilities for different months to calculate whether a day will be warm, temperate, or cold as well as whether or not it will be raining. It displays a graphic of the temperature, rain probability, and good day calculation for each day in the fall months (simplifying each month to 30 days). 

This program requires the python graphics library, and takes no inputs, since it bases the starting states off of default summer conditions.
